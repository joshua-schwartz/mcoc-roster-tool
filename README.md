# mcoc-roster-tool
A simple Vue app to help Marvel Contest of Champions players search for champions and evaluate their rosters.

Players can use this tool to filter the list of champions by Class, Tags, Size, and Tier. You will also soon be able to filter by abilities like immunities, healing, ability accuracy reduction, etc. The next step will be to add functionality to evaluate a team of five champions to help create a balanced team that can get you through most challenges.

The champion data is maintained in champ-data.js if you feel like assisting in keeping the list up to date.

The Tier designation reflects a champion's usefulness on attack and is based on the following criteria (for the sake of Tier designation assume all champs are awakened):

Tier 1 - Champions with broad usefulness and powerful mechanics (champs with more than one immunity, healing, ability accuracy reduction, etc). These champions should be able to help you in Act 5. As a rule of thumb they should be worthy of 4/40 as a 4*, or 3/45 as a 5* without worrying about it being a waste of resources. Typically champs who only do a lot of damage, like Star Lord) don't qualify.

Tier 2 - Champions who have specific uses (Daredevil for projectiles, Gambit for Variant, Ronan for stun-locking opponents with many buffs) or usefulness as a back-up option (Karnak for True Strike if you don't have Killmonger or Heimdall). These champs won't get you through the game's toughest content, but they aren't useless either.

Tier 3 - These champs don't deserve to have resources spent on ranking them up and they are essentially benched pending a buff from Kabam. The good news is there are relatively few Tier 3 champs and the list keeps shrinking as Kabam continues to release strong new champions and update weaker ones.

I wanted to create a tier list that was simple and easy to use for players making rank-up decisions, but you will find it generally parallels Seatin's more granular tier list.
